        //When reading from HttpContext.Request.Body via StreamReader() we need to keep a copy of the data
        //and reset the stream position to the beginning so that other request delegates(middleware components) are also able to read from it.
        //If you don't reset the position you will end up with a HTTP 400 or even HTTP 500 response.

        //Also when dealing with the HTTP response HttpContext.Response.Body we need to swap out the stream with one that is buffered
        //and that supports seeking.We are going to use MemoryStream for this purpose.


        //The POST calls need to be taken special care of: since we need to read from the Request body which is a stream.
        //And Streams can be read only once if not enabled Seek(). Hence we enable buffering on the Request,
        //and then read till the end of the body stream. We finally reset the Request body stream to 0 so that it can be read again by the actual endpoint.
        //The read string is saved on to the Payload attribute. We then send the Request off to further processing by calling the next.Invoke()
        //method with the HttpContext as a parameter.


        //We cannot read the Response straight away like we do on the Request, since it will not be available until the processing is done and
        //the next.Invoke() completes its execution.Hence we keep track of the Response by assigning a MemoryStream onto it.
        //And since this stream needs to be disposed properly to avoid memory issues we wrap it up under a using block.
        //The Response is written by the endpoint handler onto the memory stream instance we pass from here (instead of the actual response body)
        //and so we copy the content back to the Response body once the stream is read.
